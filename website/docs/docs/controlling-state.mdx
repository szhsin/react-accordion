# Controlling state

## From above `Accordion`

If you want to programmatically open or close accordion items from a component that is
above `Accordion` in the React tree, you could use the `ControlledAccordion` and
`useAccordionProvider`.

The value returned from `useAccordionProvider` contains a `toggle` function which can be
used to open or close any accordion items. This value should also be given to the
`providerValue` prop of the `ControlledAccordion` component.

The `toggle` function accepts two parameters. The first parameter is the `itemKey` prop of
any accordion items to toggle. The second parameter specifies whether to open or close an
item using a `boolean` value, or to toggle between the two states if the parameter is
omitted.

<ControllingState />

<CodeBlock language="jsx">{transformCodeBlock(controllingStateSource)}</CodeBlock>

:::caution NOTE

The `itemKey` prop of `AccordionItem` is not required to be globally unique, but it should
be unique among its sibling `AccordionItem` components.

Also, you don't need to specify the `itemKey` prop for an item if you don't want to
programmatically toggle it.

:::

## From underneath `Accordion`

To programmatically open or close accordion items or access the state from a component
that is underneath `Accordion` in the React tree, use the `useAccordionState` hook.

<UseStateHook />

<CodeBlock language="jsx">{transformCodeBlock(useStateHookSource)}</CodeBlock>

:::tip

If you want to access and control state of the _**current**_ item, there is a simpler way
to achieve it using the [render prop pattern](./accessing-state).
