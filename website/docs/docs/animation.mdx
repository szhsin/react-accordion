# Animation

Accordion supports expanding and collapsing animation with full state transition cycle,
thanks to the [react-transition-state](https://github.com/szhsin/react-transition-state)
library. Because how an accordion should be animated is part of styling, no default
animation is included in the package. Generally, you can follow the steps below to enable
animation:

1. set `transition` and `transitionTimeout` props on the Accordion component.

```jsx
<Accordion transition transitionTimeout={200}>
  {/* Accordion items ... */}
</Accordion>
```

If you use `ControlledAccordion` component, set the transition props with the
`useAccordionProvider` hook.

```jsx
const providerValue = useAccordionProvider({
  transition: true,
  transitionTimeout: 200
});

<ControlledAccordion providerValue={providerValue}>
  {/* Accordion items ... */}
</ControlledAccordion>;
```

2. add the `height` transition css to the item content DOM element of each accordion item,
   which is the element with class selector `szh-accordion__item-content`.

```css
transition: height 0.2s ease-in-out;
```

:::info

The transition duration in CSS should be equal to the value of `transitionTimeout` prop in
the first step.

:::

The transition of height is to create the accordion effect when items are expanded and
collapsed. Of course, you are free to animate other CSS properties to suit the needs of
your app or design system. For example, you may animate `opacity` to create fading in/out
effects.

Depending on the styling solution in your project, the methods of applying CSS transition
are slightly different. You can find some [CodeSandbox examples](styling#examples) in the
styling page which all have animation enabled.

:::caution IMPORTANT

To ensure a smooth height animation on accordion items, do not add outer vertical margin
to the children of an accordion item. Instead, use padding on the parent DOM element which
contains the children. This is the element with class selector
`szh-accordion__item-panel`.

In case outer vertical margin of the children of an accordion item cannot be practically
removed, add a vertical padding on the parent DOM element. It can be a small non-visible
padding if you don't actual need one:

```css
.szh-accordion__item-panel {
  padding: 0.1px 0;
}
```
